Scanning Host in C

My first C program scanning a host.

The code below shows how to create a C program, work with variables, and print information to the terminal.

📝 Step-by-step guide: Creating and running your program

1. Create the program file

In the terminal, type:

nano program.c


Add the following code:

// My First C Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {

    int porta = 80;
    char ip[] = "192.168.0.1";
    float ver = 1.1;

    printf("Desec Security\n");
    printf("Scan Version: %.1f \n", ver);  // prints only 1 decimal place
    printf("Scanning Host: %s on port %i \n", ip, porta);

    return 0;
}

2. Compile the program

In the terminal, type:

gcc program.c -o program


gcc → C compiler.

-o program → name of the generated executable file.

3. Run the program
./program

4. Example output
M!ss s3c
Scan Version: 1.1
Scanning Host: 192.168.0.1 on port 80

👉 What you learned here

int → integer variable type.

char[] → variable type for text (string).

float → variable type for decimal numbers.

printf() → prints information to the screen.

%.1f → formats float to one decimal place.

Compiling C programs is mandatory before execution.
